# Hi there, I'm Hamza Khan ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate Python developer with years of hands-on experience in building high-performance web applications. My expertise spans across backend development, cloud solutions, and full-stack engineering, where I bring ideas to life with clean, scalable code. I thrive on solving complex problems and architecting efficient systems that power everything from startups to large-scale enterprises.

## ðŸ”­ What I Do

As a Python enthusiast, I specialize in backend systems, leveraging the power of **Django** and **Flask** to build secure and scalable web applications.
